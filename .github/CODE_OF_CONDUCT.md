# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We, as contributors and maintainers, aim to create a productive and respectful environment for everyone involved in our project. We welcome participation from all individuals and expect everyone to contribute in a professional and constructive manner.

## Expected Behavior

To foster a positive and collaborative community, we encourage the following behaviors:

* Being respectful and considerate in your interactions.
* Welcoming constructive feedback and differing opinions.
* Focusing on the goals and success of the project.
* Communicating clearly and professionally.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not acceptable and will not be tolerated:

* Using offensive, sexualized, or inappropriate language or imagery.
* Making personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments.
* Engaging in trolling, harassment, or disruptive behavior.
* Sharing others' private information (e.g., addresses, emails) without their explicit permission.
* Any other actions that would be considered unprofessional or harmful in a collaborative setting.

## Responsibilities of Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for setting and enforcing clear standards of behavior. They have the authority to take appropriate actions, such as removing or editing contributions (e.g., comments, commits, issues) that violate this Code of Conduct. Maintainers may also temporarily or permanently ban contributors who engage in inappropriate, threatening, or harmful behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project-related spaces, including online platforms, communication channels, and public events where individuals represent the project. Representation includes using official project email addresses, social media accounts, or acting as an appointed spokesperson at events. Maintainers may further clarify what constitutes representation.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by opening an issue in this repository. All reports will be reviewed and addressed appropriately. The project team will maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

Maintainers who fail to enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face consequences, as determined by other project leaders.
